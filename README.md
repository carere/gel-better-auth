## About The Project

### Why Gel Better Auth?

Gel (formerly EdgeDB) is a wonderful database that is a joy to work with. Better Auth is the best authentication framework for TypeScript.
Obviously, they both work great together, so I decided to create this adapter to make it even better :)

### Features

- **ðŸš€ Schema Generation**: Work out of the box with any Better Auth plugins.
- **ðŸ”’ Cascading Delete**: Cascading delete is supported for all models.
- **âš¡ Indexes Support**: Works out of the box, see examples for more details.
- **ðŸ›  Constraints**: Unique flag are supported as native Gel's constraints.
- **ðŸŽ¯ Scalar Types**: Literals are represented as Scalar Type in the schema !!
- **ðŸ”¥ Link instead of Id**: relations like `userId` are represented as computed property !!

Enjoy the power of Better Auth and Gel together!

## Getting Started

Get up and running in just a few minutes.

### Prerequisites

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** (recommended) or Node.js runtime
- **[Gel/EdgeDB](https://geldata.com)** instance (prefer local)
- **[Better Auth](https://better-auth.com)** configured in your project

### Installation

1. Install the package and peer dependencies

   ```sh
   # Using Bun (recommended)
   bun add @carere/gel-better-auth better-auth gel

   # Using npm
   npm install @carere/gel-better-auth better-auth gel

   # Using pnpm
   pnpm add @carere/gel-better-auth better-auth gel
   ```

2. Set up your Gel connection

   ```sh
   # Initialize Gel project (if not already done)
   gel project init
   ```

3. Generate the Gel schema

   ```sh
   bunx @better-auth/cli generate
   ```

4. Run the watcher for automatic migrations (in dev mode)

   ```sh
   gel watch -m
   ```

## Usage

Here's how to use the adapter with your Better Auth setup:

### Basic Setup

```typescript
// auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { gelAdapter } from "@carere/gel-better-auth";
import createClient from "gel";

// Create your Gel client
const gelClient = createClient();

// Configure Better Auth with Gel adapter
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: gelAdapter(gelClient, {
    // Optional: Specify module name (defaults to "default")
    moduleName: "auth",
    
    // Optional: Define indexes for better performance
    indexes: {
      user: [
        "email",                    // Single field index
        "createdAt",                // Another single field index
        ["name", "email"]           // Composite index
      ],
      session: [
        "token",
        ["userId", "expiresAt"]      // Composite index
      ]
    }
  }),
  
  // ... rest of your Better Auth config
});
```
