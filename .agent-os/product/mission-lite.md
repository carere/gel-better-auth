# Gel Better Auth Mission (Lite)

Gel Better Auth is a database adapter library that allows developers to use Gel/EdgeDB as the database backend for Better Auth authentication systems by providing seamless type-safe integration and automatic schema generation.

Gel Better Auth serves TypeScript developers and Gel enthusiasts who need robust authentication with modern database capabilities. Unlike Gel auth, Gel Better Auth provides automatic schema generation and access to Better Auth's full feature set.
