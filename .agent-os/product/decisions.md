## 2025-08-02: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a specialized database adapter library (Gel Better Auth) for Better Auth authentication framework and Gel, targeting TypeScript developers who wants to use better-auth with Gel.

### Context

Better Auth is gaining traction as a robust authentication solution for TypeScript applications, but lacks native support for Gel. Gel offers compelling features like advanced type systems and powerful querying capabilities that appeal to modern development teams. The gap between these technologies creates friction for developers who want to use both together.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **EdgeDB Authentication Feature**
   - Pros: Built-in support for Gel via authentication extension.
   - Cons: Not as full-featured as better-auth.

2. **Better Auth Core Contribution**
   - Pros: Official support, broader ecosystem impact
   - Cons: No plan for better-auth core team to work on this, neither Gel team.

### Rationale

The specialized adapter approach provides the highest value-to-effort ratio by solving a specific, well-defined problem for a clearly identified user base. TypeScript developers using Better Auth represent a growing market segment that values type safety and developer experience. Gel's unique features and growing community justify implementing this adapter.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear market positioning and value proposition
- Focused development effort with measurable success criteria
- Strong foundation for future Gel ecosystem contributions
- Opportunity to see this project absorb by Gel core team

**Negative:**
- Limited market size compared to Postgres ecosystem
- Need to maintain compatibility with both upstream projects
